# RobloxRewindClient
Yeah I made this app for fun in order to bring back old roblox assets!
Such as...
the epic OOF sound effect
the OLD topbar (partially, not perfect)
the OLD cursor...
and more! (There isn't more)

No I will not make a mobile version

# How to install
Download the latest release and extract the zip file, and execute RobloxRewindClient.exe either from the file explorer or command prompt

# How to compile
Compile it like literally any other .NET app
